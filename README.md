This repo contains all the software needed to operate the Z-Arm 210, including the SDK to expand its capabilities. 

## Getting started
Under ./dist there is a demo application I was able to run under Windows XP.


## Developing
Documentations and binaries are dated 2018, thus act accordingly by updating dependancies.
